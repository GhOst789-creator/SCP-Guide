			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>SCP-035 is a white porcelain comedy mask, which can fit over the face of any human or humanoid. When a human or humanoid comes into contact with SCP-035, they will feel compelled to put on the mask. Once the mask is on, SCP-035 will slowly begin to control the wearer's mind and body, often resulting in extreme violence and destruction.</p>
			<p>SCP-035 is highly dangerous and should be handled with extreme caution. It is currently stored in a sealed container at Site-19.</p>

			<h2>Containment Procedures</h2>
			<p>SCP-035 is to be kept in a sealed container at Site-19. The container is to be monitored at all times by at least two armed guards. Any personnel who come into contact with SCP-035 must undergo a psychological evaluation andbeplaced under observation for a minimum of 24 hours.</p>
			<p>Any attempts to communicate with or study SCP-035 must be done remotely, using robotic or computer-controlled instruments. No personnel are allowed to directly interact with SCP-035.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="section">
			<h2>Incident Reports</h2>
			<p>There have been several incidents involving SCP-035, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Incident 035-1: A researcher who came into contact with SCP-035 began exhibiting erratic behavior and attempted to harm other personnel. The researcher was terminated.</li>
				<li>Incident 035-2: SCP-035 was briefly removed from its containment chamber for study. During this time, it managed to convince several personnel to remove their own masks and put on SCP-035. The resulting chaos resulted in several casualties and significant damage to Site-19.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Due to these incidents, all personnel are reminded to exercise extreme caution when dealing with SCP-035, and to report any unusual behavior or incidents immediately.</p>
